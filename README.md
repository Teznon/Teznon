# Hello World!

My name is London, I am a computer science and computer game design student. I am new to github and the coding world, and am excited to learn and grow on this platform!

## More specifically: 
I hope to one day design games that leave a meaningful impact on the players. I think that video games are a great medium of story telling, idea sharing, and can bring people together in unique ways. Some of the games that I have played that shaped this goal are: 
- God of War
- Horizon Zero Dawn
- Halo 3
- Persona
- The Witcher
- Skyrim
- many others that are not coming to mind as of the time of this writing :)

## Hobbies other than video games 
Some of the things I like to do that dont involve a screen and input/output:
- Snowboarding
- Rock Climbing
- Reading
- Camping
- Volunteer Fire Fighting
- Gardening

I have a few game ideas that I am working on currently, and am excited to hopefully bring them to fruition one day!

Thank you for reading!
